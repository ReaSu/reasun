&lt;p&gt;I was recently going through some old files on my computer and happened upon this following text. I wrote it when I was a struggling PhD student. I had read often that writing is a skill that needs to be practiced like a muscle. A good way to practice this muscle is to write regularly, no surprises there. An exercise often recommended is Freewriting - just write for a set time, without thinking much about it, and without stopping. Just write down whatever comes to mind. The advanced version is to pick a topic and keep writing about that. The idea is to leave the inner critic behind and just write, however nonsensical the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of those results. I thought I might as well put it up here as the planned post is taking much longer to finish than expected. I have shortened it a bit but didn't change much else. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Oh, if you're wondering about the picture - it's a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dymaxion_map"&gt;Dymaxion Map&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
