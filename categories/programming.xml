&lt;p&gt;I managed to get an ant working in C. You can view the source code here: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ReaSu/Auntie_Ant/tree/c-with-smoke"&gt;Auntie Ant&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I think it is a masterpiece of engineering? Not at all. (I'd call it C major if it were!) But it works, and I have learned a lot from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was in London this spring, I visited the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://fashiontextilemuseum.org"&gt;Fashion and Textile Museum&lt;/a&gt; and saw the exhibition of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://royal-needlework.org.uk/"&gt;Royal School of Needlework&lt;/a&gt; on the occasion of their 150th anniversary. I found it very inspiring that I decided to get out needle and thread and start my own embroidery project. But - what to embroider? I don't like purely decorative things, and I'm also not particularly fond of embellished commodities. So if I was going to embroider, the finished object would have to tick enough other boxes to make up for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had an idea, and that idea started to grow, nay, to mushroom into a veritable project. A project that ticks so many boxes that I haven't even properly thought about what to do with the finished objects. But I have thought about how and when to start working on it. Well, I had a slow start last week, and will make it a priority for the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently co-facilitated a refactoring workshop with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://code-cop.org"&gt;Code Cop Peter Kofler&lt;/a&gt;, where a participant asked an interesting question. I used to read people's blogs or listen to their talks, and they always started with "recently someone asked/mentioned/said this thing and so I thought I'd write something/give this talk about it." I used to think they just make this stuff up to have a better intro. And look at me now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was really a participant's question, I swear! But I still lied for the sake of sounding like those interesting people: it wasn't "recently", it was last year. Writing this post took so much longer than anticipated, because the more I thought about it, the more things came to my mind. It needed a lot of refactoring. For you non-coders: refactoring code is much like revising a text. You move bits around and maybe change some words, so it all becomes more coherent and less repetitive. The thing you don't want to change is the meaning, or, in the case of code, what it does. I love doing it with code, but not so much with texts. I hope you can still follow my train of thought. So here goes:&lt;/p&gt;
