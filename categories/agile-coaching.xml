&lt;p&gt;I recently co-facilitated a refactoring workshop with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://code-cop.org"&gt;Code Cop Peter Kofler&lt;/a&gt;, where a participant asked an interesting question. I used to read people's blogs or listen to their talks, and they always started with "recently someone asked/mentioned/said this thing and so I thought I'd write something/give this talk about it." I used to think they just make this stuff up to have a better intro. And look at me now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was really a participant's question, I swear! But I still lied for the sake of sounding like those interesting people: it wasn't "recently", it was last year. Writing this post took so much longer than anticipated, because the more I thought about it, the more things came to my mind. It needed a lot of refactoring. For you non-coders: refactoring code is much like revising a text. You move bits around and maybe change some words, so it all becomes more coherent and less repetitive. The thing you don't want to change is the meaning, or, in the case of code, what it does. I love doing it with code, but not so much with texts. I hope you can still follow my train of thought. So here goes:&lt;/p&gt;
