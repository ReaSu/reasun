&lt;p&gt;When I was in London this spring, I visited the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://fashiontextilemuseum.org"&gt;Fashion and Textile Museum&lt;/a&gt; and saw the exhibition of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://royal-needlework.org.uk/"&gt;Royal School of Needlework&lt;/a&gt; on the occasion of their 150th anniversary. I found it very inspiring that I decided to get out needle and thread and start my own embroidery project. But - what to embroider? I don't like purely decorative things, and I'm also not particularly fond of embellished commodities. So if I was going to embroider, the finished object would have to tick enough other boxes to make up for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had an idea, and that idea started to grow, nay, to mushroom into a veritable project. A project that ticks so many boxes that I haven't even properly thought about what to do with the finished objects. But I have thought about how and when to start working on it. Well, I had a slow start last week, and will make it a priority for the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;15 years ago today (or was it 16 years? It might have been) I had an accident. No, I caused an accident. Luckily, noone was hurt. Just me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a hot Friday afternoon. There was going to be a party at a park later that night, to celebrate a friend's PhD graduation, and I was preparing a big batch of hummus for everyone. I had soaked and boiled the chickpeas already, and was trying to purée them with an immersion blender. The chickpeas didn't cooperate, and clogged the housing around the blades pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an avowed atheist, I don't celebrate Christmas. I'm also of the opinion that public holidays tied to religious (i.e. Christian) holidays don't agree with a secular society. Not to speak of the discrimination of all religious, but non-Christian people. Why not just give people ten more days of paid free time, to use whenever they choose? Everyone could celebrate their own special days, be they religious or not. But that's a different story and shall be told some other time.&lt;/p&gt;
