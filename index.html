</figcaption></figure><p>In the <a class="reference external" href="posts/coding-is-like-fencing/">last post</a> I wrote about how very tangible the results of the "artificial" exercise were at the fencing practice I obsered. Witnessing this made reflect on the deliberate practice we as software crafters do. I want to get to the bottom of this, and tease out the differences between the two kinds of practice.</p>

</figcaption></figure><p>I had the pleasure of watching fencing practice a couple days ago. It was only three people - the coach, and two participants. One of them started only recently, the other one has some years of practice under his belt. While I was listening to the coach, I couldn't help but think about coding exercises. Her words could have been used almost verbatim to introduce a coding dojo. Is coding like fencing, then? There is quite an overlap, yes. But I think there's still room for improvement. Let me walk you through what I witnessed that evening, and where I think coding practice falls short.</p>

</figcaption></figure><p>When I was in London this spring, I visited the <a class="reference external" href="https://fashiontextilemuseum.org">Fashion and Textile Museum</a> and saw the exhibition of the <a class="reference external" href="https://royal-needlework.org.uk/">Royal School of Needlework</a> on the occasion of their 150th anniversary. I found it very inspiring that I decided to get out needle and thread and start my own embroidery project. But - what to embroider? I don't like purely decorative things, and I'm also not particularly fond of embellished commodities. So if I was going to embroider, the finished object would have to tick enough other boxes to make up for that.</p>
<p>I had an idea, and that idea started to grow, nay, to mushroom into a veritable project. A project that ticks so many boxes that I haven't even properly thought about what to do with the finished objects. But I have thought about how and when to start working on it. Well, I had a slow start last week, and will make it a priority for the coming months.</p>

<p>It was a hot Friday afternoon. There was going to be a party at a park later that night, to celebrate a friend's PhD graduation, and I was preparing a big batch of hummus for everyone. I had soaked and boiled the chickpeas already, and was trying to purée them with an immersion blender. The chickpeas didn't cooperate, and clogged the housing around the blades pretty quickly.</p>

</figcaption></figure><p>I recently co-facilitated a refactoring workshop with <a class="reference external" href="http://code-cop.org">Code Cop Peter Kofler</a>, where a participant asked an interesting question. I used to read people's blogs or listen to their talks, and they always started with "recently someone asked/mentioned/said this thing and so I thought I'd write something/give this talk about it." I used to think they just make this stuff up to have a better intro. And look at me now!</p>
<p>It was really a participant's question, I swear! But I still lied for the sake of sounding like those interesting people: it wasn't "recently", it was last year. Writing this post took so much longer than anticipated, because the more I thought about it, the more things came to my mind. It needed a lot of refactoring. For you non-coders: refactoring code is much like revising a text. You move bits around and maybe change some words, so it all becomes more coherent and less repetitive. The thing you don't want to change is the meaning, or, in the case of code, what it does. I love doing it with code, but not so much with texts. I hope you can still follow my train of thought. So here goes:</p>

</figcaption></figure><p>I was recently going through some old files on my computer and happened upon this following text. I wrote it when I was a struggling PhD student. I had read often that writing is a skill that needs to be practiced like a muscle. A good way to practice this muscle is to write regularly, no surprises there. An exercise often recommended is Freewriting - just write for a set time, without thinking much about it, and without stopping. Just write down whatever comes to mind. The advanced version is to pick a topic and keep writing about that. The idea is to leave the inner critic behind and just write, however nonsensical the result.</p>
<p>This is one of those results. I thought I might as well put it up here as the planned post is taking much longer to finish than expected. I have shortened it a bit but didn't change much else. Enjoy!</p>

You lost a screw on your mudgard - don't think you can just get a replacement from the hardware store. Because that's illegal too. Next time you find a loose screw, you want to tighten it, but that would void your warranty. Hey, at least it's not illegal!</p>
<p>All these steps - buying a bicycle, adding a new accessory, repair it, replace parts - can only be done by a certified dealer or carried out at an accredited repair shop.</p>
