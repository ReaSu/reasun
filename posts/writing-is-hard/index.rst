Despite the hours I've spent writing, re-writing and reconsidering my points of view on a variety of subjects, I have no result to show for it, no finished blog posts published in over 4 months. Why is this?

Let's have a look at how I get ideas for posts, how I approach my writing, and where the whole process breaks down.

.. END_TEASER

I don't sit down with the intention of finding a new topic. I usually hear, see or read a Thing, and it immediately reminds me of that OtherThing that is entirely unrelated. And I find this connection so interesting, I want to share it. Or I come across the same WrongThing over and over again, and it really bugs me, and I want to get that frustration out of my system. So I want to write about how Thing and OtherThing are related, how OtherThing might add a new perspective to Thing, or why WrongThing is wrong in the first place. I consider these to be worthy topics.

So I fire up my trusty text editor and start writing. I see this beautiful story arc unfolding in front of me, and I try to follow it as best as I can before it disappears again into the mists of oblivion. Then, before I write the conclusion, I go back over the text again to make sure the conclusion actually fits what I wrote before. More often than not, I find that it's rather skimpy on details. Have I made it clear enough why Thing and OtherThing are similar in any way, shape, or form? How is that similarity relevant? What am I actually comparing OtherThing to? What exactly bugged me about that WrongThing, or what piqued my interest in the Thing? Is this Thing even true? Why am I so sure WrongThing is wrong? Are there any sources or references I could quote? Does my argument even hold?

In other words, I start second guessing myself. I try to find another argument, look at references and sources, start digging just a tiny little bit deeper. It's not a scientific treaty I'm after, it's just a blog post. But still: Can I justify what I just wrote? There's more than one way this can go. 

* Sometimes it turns out that Thing was actually not quite right. If I correct it, the parallels to OtherThing disappear.
* Sometimes I fall into a rabbit hole and start adding more detail to either Thing or OtherThing, until I realise that the story arc doesn't actually support such a weight, but was reduced to a rubble a while ago.
* Sometimes I start adding detail, get sidetracked by what I discover, and when I come back, the story I was going to tell is just ... lame.
* Sometimes I find that WrongThing is wrong indeed, but the way I framed it is rather skewed, too.
* Sometimes I realise that I have been blowing things up, and all I want to say can be said in one sentence.

And there's a whole host of other possible outcomes. 

Alas, what's someone to do? Is this still worth writing about? Can I build a new story arc? Is this even worth sharing? This is the point where I often give up, and abandon the draft. I'll have a fresh look tomorrow, in a week, when I get the chance, I tell myself. But you know how that ends.

While writing this (and getting sidetracked, and into a rabbit hole, and ending in a different place than I'd intended) and breaking down my process into discrete steps, I noticed various potential weak points. I also, obviously, found a plethora of writings on how to write good stories, blog posts, books. But instead of reading All Teh Thingz, I decided to come back here, and see this through.

To sum it up: I struggle with writing 
* because I often start with a vague idea that doesn't stand up to scrutiny
* because certain things make sense only in my head
* because I try to pack too much into one post
* because there's not enough content to fill a post
* because I become enamoured with the story more than the content
* because I get distracted easily by new, shiny things
* because my plan/outline is not concrete enough to keep me from straying
* because I try to get everything right in the first draft - content, story, style
* and of course because I'm my own worst critic.

I think this list should give me something to work with in the future.

How do you, dear reader, approach writing? I'm really curious!
