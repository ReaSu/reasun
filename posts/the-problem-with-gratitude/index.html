<!-- END_TEASER -->
<p>The benefits are all-encompassing: according to research it will improve your physical and mental health, your social life, your career and even your personality! From an increase in self-esteem and optimism to stronger and healthier relationships that lead to more support in crisis all the way to improved decision-making and reduced blood pressure, gratitude can boost it all. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p>As for the what - be grateful for what other people give you, but also for your health, for having a roof over your head, for all the things you take for granted. For experiences big and small - smells and sights and holidays. In short: there's always something to be grateful for.</p>
<p>There's only one problem with all of this:</p>
<p>Who should we be grateful to? There are easy cases - the person who held the door, the friend who made me laugh, the courier who brings my take-out. But what about all the more abstract things? Health, the dry and warm dwelling? The warmth of the sun on a late autumn afternoon, the sound of waves, the smell of a book, the texture of wool? Noone causes them. They just are. Not to make me happy, but entirely independently of my existence.</p>
<p>Please, please, please dear content creators out there: You cannot just be grateful. You are grateful TO SOMEBODY for something. Both parts are arguments, not adjuncts. In other words: they are both required in the sentence. What is more, the first argument has to be capable of action. You cannot be grateful to a stone for missing you - it didn't do anything to hit or miss you. It doesn't have agency. Neither do the universe, nature or evolution. Believers may be grateful to their deities of choice. For everyone else, there is noone to be grateful to.</p>
<p>Is it true, then? Are atheists condemned to a life of misery because they can't benefit from all the positive impacts the gratitude attitude has? Far from it. We can simply <strong>appreciate</strong> the intricacies of language, its nuance and detail that enables us to express our thoughts.</p>
<p>So: go forth and appreciate all the big and small things that make life worth living, that can be found in every day, and that will ultimately improve all areas of your life. I, for one, appreciate all your comments. Today I'm especially especially curious about <strong>your</strong> pet peeves!</p>
