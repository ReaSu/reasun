This is an honest question, not just some retoric or clickbait (Ha! clickbait on this site with a maximum of five readers! ridiculous.)

These are some of my concerns:

Software uses energy to run. Data uses energy to stay in whatever state it is stored. Data uses energy to travel from here to there. We, the "civilised" citizens of this world, use a lot of software every day, every hour. We store tons of data (and some companies even more than that!), and we are so used to having every piece of information at our fingertips, which means there is an incredible amount of data traversing networks. And all of this requires an incredible amount of energy. (I will have to check if there any estimates available on just how much we are speaking.)

Where does all this energy come from? It's not all wind turbines and solar panels, that's for sure.

Then, there's the hardware all this software runs on, the data is stored on, and that powers the networks. The plastic in this hardware is, honestly, the least of my concerns. Minerals required to build this hardware is often mined under dangerous, inhumane conditions, often using child labour. The money generated often fuels cruel wars. The suffering of those workers is one part of the uncounted costs of this hardware. Damage to the environment, the planet just adds to this.
