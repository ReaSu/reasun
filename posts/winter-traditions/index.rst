As an avowed atheist, I don't celebrate Christmas. I'm also of the opinion that public holidays tied to religious (i.e. Christian) holidays don't agree with a secular society. Not to speak of the discrimination of all religious, but non-Christian people. Why not just give people ten more days of paid free time, to use whenever they choose? Everyone could celebrate their own special days, be they religious or not. But that's a different story and shall be told some other time.

Back to Christmas and other winter festivities. It's not only the religious background of Christmas that makes me avoid it. I also disagree very strongly with the commercial side of it. I also don't really celebrate New Year's Eve. Why should that night carry any more weight in the flow of time than any other? Besides, I'm not a fan of fireworks and collective benders. And why bother with resolutions if you won't keep them anyway? They will only make you feel miserable. Real change can start any day, not just on that specific random day. Again, this is a different story that shall be told some other time.

At the same time, winters are tough for me, and I dread them as soon as the evenings get cooler. It's not the cold that I mind, it's the lack of daylight in general, and sunshine in particular. I live in an area where winters are often foggy, and there was very little snow in the past few years. Often, the black dead trees are the only thing to provide some change in the eternal grey, but you couldn't call them uplifting either.

When it gets dark in the middle of the afternoon, I lose track of time. I go to bed later and later each day, which leads to waking up later and later, which leads to less and less daylight in my eyes, which leads to my sense of time getting worse - a vicious circle.

Wouldn't it be a good idea to have something to look forward to during these dark and trying times? When spring is just too far away to hold on to? For many, Christmas, Hanukkah, or Yule is that thing. A celebration with lights and good food and a loving family. The memories I have of Christmas are full of tensions, stress, and resentments, thinly veiled behind a facade of candle light and food I didn't care for.

But who says I have to celebrate Christmas? Or Yule? Or any other celebration that has meaning for some group of people I don't associate with? Who says I have to follow traditions that mean nothing to me? 

This year, I will start making my own tradition. My own rituals I can look forward to. I don't know yet what they will be, but will make them up over the next couple of weeks - and months and years. They might include a lot of light, hot chocolate, a good book and/or some woolly crafts. Maybe some walks. I even have half a mind of putting up some decorations!

Some other things that make me hate winter not quite as much:

* Baking Biscuits with S. For the past couple of years we had a weekend of making way too many of them - to give away and to eat. All the while talking, listening to music, having savoury food.
* The mathematical Advent Calendar by `Matthew Scroggs <https://www.mscroggs.co.uk>`_ that will hopefully appear in due course
* `Advent of Code <https://adventofcode.com/2021>`_. I haven't completed one of those yet, but I like to try anyway.
* Visiting K., meeting C. and J. for game night and chats. Last year we did a socially distanced version. I don't even dare to hope that we could meet in person. But I'd love to meet online!
* One old tradition I've missed the past couple of years was breakfast with (the other) S. Maybe we can reintroduce it this year?

What are your winter traditions?
