I have been spending the past few days in West Yorkshire. This is in the north of England, near the city of Leeds. The area is steeped in its history of textile industry, and there are sheep everywhere. I'm very fond of that, but I also love the landscape here. There are lush forests and little streams, there are hills to walk up and around, and there's the moors.

Yesterday I took a walk across some of those. After having spent some time here pre-pandemic, I am quite familiar with the immediate surroundings
